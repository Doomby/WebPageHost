[Report Bug](https://github.com/thgossler/WebPageHost/issues) Â· [Request Feature](https://github.com/thgossler/WebPageHost/issues)


## About The Project

This is a Windows simple command line interface (CLI) tool for opening web page URLs in an embedded Microsoft WebView2 control. It has a variety of options to control the behavior of the window and the embedded web browser. Further, it supports customization of the output via JavaScript.

> _**Note:** This tool was written by me in my spare time and will be developed only sporadically._


### Built With

* [.NET 6 (C#)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)
* [WinForms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)
* [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
* [Spectre Console Cli](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console)
* [InputSimulator.Core](https://github.com/cwevers/InputSimulatorCore)

> _**Note**: I would like to make this tool also available on Linux some day. I have chosen WinForms initially because it was the fasted way for me to put this tool together :smiley:, it is open source and is still supported by Microsoft. And, I still haven't given up hope that it will eventually be available on Linux including the WebView2 wrapper control. In case WPF or MAUI should be available on Linux earlier than WinForms, the source code should be migrated. Alternatively, [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/) could be considered._


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Latest .NET SDK
  ```sh
  winget install -e --id Microsoft.dotnet

   ```
